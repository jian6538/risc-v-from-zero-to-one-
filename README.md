this is my journey to complete 
32-bit pipelined RISC-V core (RV32I instruction set)

5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback)

Basic memory-mapped I/O

UART/LED peripheral or simple GPIO

it include resource learning material as well as step by step guide to the implementation.
